Spitwads are not free speech. Nobody likes sun burn slappers. High explosives and school don’t mix. I will not squeak chalk. I will finish what I staBart Bucks are not legal tender. I will not fake rabies. Underwear should be worn on the inside. The Christmas Pageant does not stink. I will not torment the emotionally frail. I will not carve gods. I will not spank others. I will not aim for the head. I will not barf unless I’m sick. I saw nothing unusual in the teacher’s lounge. I will not conduct my own fire drills. Funny noises are not funny. I will not spin the turtle. I will not snap bras. I will not fake seizures. This punishment is not boring and pointless. My name is not Dr. Death. I will not defame New Orleans. This was due to complaints regarding the song, New Orleans from the previous episode. I will not prescribe medication. I will not bury the new kid. I will not teach others to fly. I will not bring sheep to class. A burp is not an answer. Teacher is not a leper. Coffee is not for kids. Each line becomes less legible and more scrawled, as coffee can sometimes make a person drowsy after a while. I will not eat things for money. However, Bart actually ate things for money twenty one seasons later in Diggs. I will not yell She’s dead during roll call. The principal’s toupée is not a frisbee. I will not call the principal

meaningless milestones. There are plenty of businesses like show business. I will not re-transmit without the express permission of Major League Baseball. Five days is not too long to wait for a gun. Beans are neither fruit nor musical. No one is interested in my underpants. I will not use abbrev. I am not the reincarnation of Sammy Davis Jr. I will not send lard through the mail. I will not dissect things unless instructed. I will not whittle hall passes out of soap. My homework was not stolen by a one-armed man. Ralph won’t morph if you squeeze him hard enough. Adding just kidding doesn’t make it okay to insult the principal. Bagman is not a legitimate career choice. Cursive writing does not mean what I think it does. Next time it could be me on the scaffolding. I will not hang donuts on my person. I will remember to take my medication. I will not strut around like I own the place. The Good Humor man can only be pushed so far. I do not have power of attorney over first graders. Nerve gas is not a toy. I will not mock Mrs. Dumbface. The First Amendmentdoes not cover burping. This is not a clue... or is it?I will not complain about the solution when I hear it. Bewitched does not promote Satanism. No one wants to hear from my armpits. I am not a lean mean spitting machine. The boys’ room is not a water park. Indian burns are not

will not hide the teacher’s Prozac. A fire drill does not demand a fire. I did not learn everything I need to know in kindergarten. I no longer want myMTV. Everyone is tired of that Richard Gerestory. I did not invent Irish dancing. I will not tease Fatty. There was no Roman god named Fartacus. Rudolph’s red nose is not alcohol-related. Shooting paintballs is not an art form. Pain is not the cleanser. Silly string is not a nasal spray. I was told not to do this. My butt does not deserve a website. I will not demand what I’m worth. I will not mess with the opening credits. I am not the new Dalai Lama. I was not the inspiration for Kramer. I will not file frivolous lawsuits. The Simpsons Halloween Special IXbutt. com is not my e-mail address. No one cares what my definition of is is. I will not scream for ice cream. I am not a licensed hairstylist. The President did it is not an excuse. My mom is not dating Jerry Seinfeld. Sherri does not got back. I
